# Design review decisions

Running log of decisions made during review of `DESIGN.md`. Newest last.
Each entry records what was decided and why, so the reasoning survives the
conversation it was made in.

## D1 — DESIGN.md is scoped to the near-term QBO front-end

**Decided:** `DESIGN.md` covers `qbo-local` — the local replica and fast UI that
puts QBO data on local disk and keeps the network out of the interaction path.
The double-entry accounting system is a later project and gets its own
`LEDGER-DESIGN.md`, written when that project starts.

**Why:** `qbo-local` ships in weeks and is the near-term priority. The accounting
system is intentionally less defined for now — "start off QuickBooks-like, then
build out features that make sense for me" — so designing it in detail today
would be designing against requirements that do not exist yet.

**Consequence:** the posting-rules table, the double-entry schema, and the ledger
command/oplog design leave `DESIGN.md`. They are prerequisites for the ledger
project, not for this one — `qbo-local` posts nothing, it mirrors what QBO has
already computed.

## D2 — Approved structure for DESIGN.md

1. Money and rounding — kept as drafted
2. Domain enums and QBO entity models — kept as drafted
3. Replica schema — SQLite tables, FTS5 search (new)
4. Sync: CDC cursor strategy and its failure modes (new)
5. Token rotation and durable credential persistence (new)
6. The outbox: state machine, rejection handling, dependency resolution (new)
7. Reconciliation sweep (new)
8. Safety: read-only default, audit log, backups (new)
9. Forward-looking note on the accounting system — direction, not design (shrunk)

Sections 3-8 do not exist in the current draft and are the substance of the
rewrite. Several depend on Intuit API facts the current draft left explicitly
unverified (CDC lookback window and entity coverage, current rate limits);
these get verified against live Intuit documentation and cited.
